ExportDB is a centralized dataset of supported and unsupported export cases.
It is targeted towards users who want to understand specifically what types of
code are supported, the subtleties of export, and how to modify their existing
code to be compatible with export. Note that this is not an exhaustive set of
everything that is supported by exportdb, but it covers the
most common and confusing use cases that users will run into.

If you have a feature that you think needs a stronger guarantee from us to
support in export please create an issue in the pytorch/pytorch repo with a module:export tag.
